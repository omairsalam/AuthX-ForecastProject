# AuthX Forecast Automation Project

<p> This project stemmed from a need to automate many processes that were going on in AuthX at highly regular intervals. At the weekly resource meetings, a tedious process involving ascertaining data from a website called ForecastApp.com and then imnporting the data into Excel and then plotting the graphs took place to see what the data meant took place. The specific steps were: 
<ol> 
  <li> Obtain data from ForecastApp.com using the following method: 
  <ol>
    <li> Login to ForecastApp.com using one of the admin accounts </li> 
    <li> Navigate to the exports page </li> 
    <li> Click on the export button and save the txt file containing the forecasted numbers of next week. </li> 
  </ol>
